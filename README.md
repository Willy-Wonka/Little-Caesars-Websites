# Little-Caesars-Websites
January 2013 â€“ April 2013 
Our group (two people) developed websites for Little Caesars in Kamloops. 
I focused on design and coding web pages, especially the Nutrition and the Take Out & Delivery pages. 
Formatting paragraphs and tables, adding pictures and make sure the links is working and connect to the right pages. 
Also I completed documentation like Cross reference, business statement and web story board with teammate.
